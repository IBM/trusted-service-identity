# reset - indicates whether the setup will remove the existing securtiy
# components and recreate them, or keep the existing ones as is.
# if reset.all set to "true" the setup helm chart will remove the existing
# private key, CSR and x5c and create new private key and CSR.
#
# if reset.x5c is set to "true", the helm chart will only remove the x5c
# that allows creating a new one.
#
# Setting them to "false" would preserve the current values if they exist
# or create new ones if they don't
