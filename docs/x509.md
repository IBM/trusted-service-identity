# Tornjak + SPIRE with x509pop (Proof of Possession) for Confidential Computing project
The `x509pop` nodeAttestor plugin attests nodes that have been provisioned with
an x509 identity through an out-of-band mechanism.
It verifies that the certificate is rooted to a trusted set of CAs
and issues a signature based proof-of-possession challenge to the agent plugin
to verify that the node is in possession of the private key.


## Pre-install: Get the code and create Keys
### Get the code
Obtain the clone of the repo:

```console
git clone https://github.com/IBM/trusted-service-identity.git
git checkout conf_container
```
### Create keys and certificates for testing
Keys are already created in `sample-x509` directory.

The script for generating keys is based on:
https://github.com/spiffe/spire/blob/v1.2.0/test/fixture/nodeattestor/x509pop/generate.go

To create new sample keys:
```console
cd sample-x509
go run generate.go
cd ..
```

Setting up the keys for SPIRE Server:
* generate rootCA key
* create rootCert (rootKey)
* generate intermediate Key
* create intermediateCert(intermKey, rootKey, rootCert)


## Install the SPIRE Server with OIDC and Vault
Create a new namespace
```console
kubectl create ns tornjak
```

Server NodeAttestor just needs the rootCA cert for verification (rootCA.pem)

Pass the cert as a Secret:
```console

kubectl -n tornjak create secret generic sample-x509 \
--from-file=rootCA.pem="sample-x509/root-crt.pem"
```

### Server deployment
Here we are using OpenShift cluster in IBM Cloud.
Setup `KUBECONFIG` and deploy:

```console
# use a script to get CLUSTER_NAME
utils/get-cluster-info.sh

# or set it up explicitly:
export CLUSTER_NAME=openshift-ibmcloud-01
utils/install-open-shift-tornjak.sh -c $CLUSTER_NAME -t openshift.space-x.com --oidc
```

Test access to Tornjak and OIDC, as shown at the end of the deployment.

Capture the `spire-bundle` to be used for Spire Agents:

```console
kubectl -n tornjak get configmap spire-bundle -oyaml | kubectl patch --type json --patch '[{"op": "replace", "path": "/metadata/namespace", "value":"spire"}]' -f - --dry-run=client -oyaml > spire-bundle.yaml
```

### Setup Vault with OIDC:
https://github.com/IBM/trusted-service-identity/blob/main/docs/spire-oidc-vault.md

## Deploy SPIRE Agents in Remote Clusters
Follow the deployment of [agent with x509](./x509-agent.md)

### To cleanup the cluster (removes everything)

```console
utils/install-open-shift-tornjak.sh --clean
```
